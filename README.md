## Instructions
* If you want to use the Twiki utilities on the dashboard, make a `~/.twikipw` file that contains only your Twiki password. Of course, you should `chmod 600` it.
* If beginning a new campaign, make sure to update JECs, CMSSW release, pset names, etc. inside `params.py`, otherwise, don't need to touch this
* `source setup.sh` will set up your environment and make the dashboard
* Use the dashboard to create an `instructions.txt` file
* At this point, I prefer to start a screen and then make sure to `source setup.sh` (maybe a couple of times until it doesn't complain).
* `python run.py instructions.txt`
* Sit back and relax

## TODO:
- [ ] Check that nothing happened to the files after copying (don't need to do full blown checkCMS3, just check event counts or something)
- [ ] Parse checkCMS3 output and remake stuff appropriately
- [x] Be able to change xsec, kfact, efact before post-processing (through an updated instructions.txt)
- [ ] Copy metadata to backup directory
- [ ] If merged files are already in the final directory, either warn users or mark job as done
- [ ] Be able to nuke and resubmit job from dashboard
- [x] Resubmit crab task if been bootstrapped or some other thing for longer than x minutes
- [ ] Before release, remove debugging and grep for "Autotupletest" and fix
- [ ] Don't wait on last x% of MC samples to finish up in crab
- [ ] Have Condor submission possibility for certain jobs that misbehave
- [x] Make postprocessing part of sample show all jobs done when in done state
- [x] If user enters full twiki name into the dashboard, automatically strip the beginning part to get only the end
- [x] Re-read instructions.txt file every iteration to pull in new information/samples
